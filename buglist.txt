Remaining Bugs:
- Going immediately sideways breaks Disappearing Trail
- Holding right while countdown happens or something freezes the game until let go?
- There's some weird collision edge cases
- Make music loop
- 8 Player controller connection issues
- Boost & Disappearing Trail have issues at the same time - ie. while boosting the disappearing speeds up but can't round corners, lengthening your trail
