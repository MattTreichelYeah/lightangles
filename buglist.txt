Remaining Bugs:
- Going immediately sideways breaks Disappearing Trail
- Boosting extends your hitbox forward in a way that could be subtle but awkward. The problem is the hitbox x and y can't be placed backwards onto their own trails to accomodate for the boost travel or it causes a suicide.
- Pausing doesn't pause the timer for boosting, wasting your boost but probably also recharging it
- Occasional Lag
- Music loop is a bit rough (setting Audio.currentTime has a delay)
- 8 Player only works in FireFox
- Boost & Disappearing Trail have issues at the same time - ie. while boosting the disappearing speeds up but can't round corners, lengthening your trail

Playtest 1:
- Messages should just finish on a timer without input
- The 'Champ' message should offer option to return to menu or continue
- Bug where one player spawned sideways?

- Oh yeah, massive refactoring is necessary
