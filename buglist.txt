Remaining Bugs:
- Going immediately sideways breaks Disappearing Trail (Couldn't reproduce recently)
- Boosting extends your hitbox forward in a way that could be subtle but awkward. The problem is the hitbox x and y can't be placed backwards onto their own trails to accomodate for the boost travel or it causes a suicide.
- Pausing doesn't pause the timer for boosting, wasting your boost but probably also recharging it
- Lag in 8 Player (but only really bad at first use, before caching?)
- Music loop is a bit rough (setting Audio.currentTime has a delay)
- 8 Player only works in FireFox
- Boost & Disappearing Trail have issues at the same time - ie. while boosting the disappearing speeds up but can't round corners, lengthening your trail

- Oh yeah, massive refactoring is necessary
