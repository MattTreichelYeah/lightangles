Remaining Bugs:
- Going immediately sideways breaks Disappearing Trail (Can't reproduce immediate sideways)
- There's some weird collision edge cases
- Lag in 8 Player (but only really bad at first use, before caching?)
- Music loop is a bit rough (setting Audio.currentTime has a delay)
- 8 Player controller connection issues
- Boost & Disappearing Trail have issues at the same time - ie. while boosting the disappearing speeds up but can't round corners, lengthening your trail

- Oh yeah, massive refactoring is necessary
