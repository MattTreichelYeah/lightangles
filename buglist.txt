Remaining Bugs:
- Going immediately sideways breaks Disappearing Trail
- Pausing doesn't pause the timer for boosting, wasting your boost but probably also recharging it
- Music loop is a bit rough (setting Audio.currentTime has a delay)
- 8 Player+ only works in FireFox
- Boost & Disappearing Trail have issues at the same time - ie. while boosting the disappearing speeds up but can't round corners, lengthening your trail

Playtest Impressions:
- Bug where players spawn sideways sometimes, maybe due to holding an input between rounds?
- Sound effects get cut off in Firefox, should probably initialize new ones each use?

Design Issues:
- CPU Players really need a tiny bit more predictive behaviour, chance to make a turn should increase the closer they get to any line that's directly in front of them, instead of so many last turns that box them in
