Remaining Bugs:
- Going immediately sideways breaks Disappearing Trail
- Pausing doesn't pause the timer for boosting, wasting your boost but probably also recharging it
- Music loop is a bit rough (setting Audio.currentTime has a delay)
- 8 Player+ only works in FireFox
- Boost & Disappearing Trail have issues at the same time - ie. while boosting the disappearing speeds up but can't round corners, lengthening your trail

Playtest 1:
- Bug where one player spawned sideways?

- Oh yeah, massive refactoring is necessary

- Should have mechanic for knocked out players in large playercount games

- Sound effects get cut off in Firefox, should probably initialize new ones each use?
